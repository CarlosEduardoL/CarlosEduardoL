- Jenkins
- Ansible

## Personal projects ðŸš€
 
Lately, Iâ€™ve been very involved in learning Rust as a hobby and have made several CLIs that replicate the functionality of some of the GNU utils tools such as [cat](https://github.com/CarlosEduardoL/crab) and [echo](https://github.com/CarlosEduardoL/say).

I also really enjoy helping others learn. I have a [repository](https://github.com/CarlosEduardoL/algorithms) where Iâ€™m implementing different algorithms and basic data structures as well-documented as I can so that it serves as a learning resource for those just starting out in programming WIP.
